This is the LEMP stack I've been playing with when setting up my own servers for WordPress.

My goal is create something that can handle 10,000 real time users at once on limited hardware.

If you plan on using this I assume you at least sorta know what you're doing in SSH and I take no responsibility if you screw something up. I cannot offer support for this either.

This entire thing is for me, myself, and I so use at your own risk.
