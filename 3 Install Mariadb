Faster and leaner than standard mySQL so let's use it!

sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client

After it’s installed, MariaDB server should be automatically stared. Use systemctl to check its status.

systemctl status mysql

Then you outta see an output like this:
mysql.service - LSB: Start and stop the mysql database server daemon
Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/mysql; bad; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Wed 2016-04-20 18:52:01 EDT; 1min 30s ago
Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)

If it’s not running, start it with this command:
sudo systemctl start mysql

To enable MariaDB to automatically start when Ubuntu 16.04 is rebooted:
sudo systemctl enable mysql

Now run the post installation security script.

sudo mysql_secure_installation
When it asks you to enter MariaDB root password, press enter because you have not set the root password yet. Then enter y to set the root password for MariaDB server.
