Ubuntu has made installing a lot of software easier than ever. Installing nginx is one simple line. Run it and follow any prompts you're given.

apt-get install nginx

When that completes, nginx will be installed, but needs configuring for WordPress. nginx configuration files are in /etc/nginx

First, edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Inside the http section , insert the following lines so that when you later add varnish in front, things don’t break all over the place, and so varnish caches compressed files:

port_in_redirect off;
gzip  on;
gzip_types text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript;
gzip_vary on;
Next, cd to /etc/nginx/conf.d and create a new file, /etc/nginx/conf.d/drop with the contents of the drop file from GitHub

Then, replace /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf with the contents of the github default.conf file changing all entries for domainname.com with your own domain name (there’s 3 entries, including 1 near the bottom): https://github.com/ewanleith/Wordpress-Server-Configuration-Files/blob/master/default.conf

Make a directory, /var/www/ and set the ownership:

mkdir -p /var/www/
chown nginx:nginx /var/www/
chmod 775 /var/www

That’s nginx configured, restart it:
service nginx restart
